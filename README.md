# Portfolio

A website acting as Portfolio, visual resume and business card.
It is designed to show off my talents as a Graphic Designer, UI/UX Designer and Full-Stack Web Developer showcasing technical skills and content creation through various projects I have worked on.

### About

This section is a brief summary about myself and career. 

### My Skills

This section is a listing my skills and qualifications (currently under construction).

### My Pojects

This section is a showcasing of past projects with full descriptions, tools and skills lists, and links to the live site as well as the GitHub reprository of each project.
I also added cool example photos that show the responsive design of each project. No projects are featured yet. (no projects are featured yet. this is just the layout and design so far.)

### Contact

Finally, a contact section with links to my LinkedIN, GitHub, Dev, CareerKarma and Twitter profiles. Also included is a contact form that send me a direct email.

## Future Updates

The skills section will be updated. I have plans for a more dynamic and immersive layout. I will also be adding a link to my DevianArt profile in the contacts section. Also, projects will be posted in the projects section.
